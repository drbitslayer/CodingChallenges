Radio Transmitter Problem
=========================

Problem
-------

There is a radio transmitter that is emitting a signal every certain number of hours or minutes.
The lenght of time doesn't really matter, but a long time between signals motivates you to come up with a 
cool mathematical solution.

You have a device that receives the transmission and can tell you the distance you are from the transmission.

So say you're standing @ 0,0 and your receiver tells you that you are 5 units away.

Next you move to 6,8 and you receiver tells you that you are again 5 units away.


Input
-----

x1 y1 r1
x2 y2 r2

Output
------

One or two x,y values indicating the location of the transmitter.

Also you can certain conditions that yield no results, or infinite results.  

Check the code for the details.


Goal
----

It might be cool to make a canvas-based javascript version of this for the fun of it.
